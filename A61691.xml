            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>WHereas a Lying Pamphlet being come to my hands of <hi>William Brownſwords,</hi> who profeſſes himſelf to be a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the Goſpel at <hi>Kendal;</hi> but his Fruits and Practices doth rather demonſtrate him to be <hi>a Miniſter</hi> of <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> and of that Generation that cryed, Report, and we will report it, who ever did and doth report their lies, and ſlanders againſt the Innocent, to make the truth odious, who are of that generation that ſhuts the Kingdome of God againſt men, neither entering (by Chriſt the light) themſelves, nor ſuffering them that would; but endeavours to perſwade people that it is Popery, and dangerous to hearken to the light of Chriſt within them, and ſo endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to divert them from the means of recovery out of the ſhaddow of death and groſſe darkneſſe, which hath over ſpread the whole world; out of which there is no way or means, but in and through <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who is the <hi>true light</hi> of the world; and did ſo teſtify of himſelf, that all people might believe in him, to have Life and Salvation, who redeems mankind out of ſin, and ſaves from deſtruction, and gives Eternal Life to as many as believes in him, and leads out of darkneſſe all them that follow him; in whoſe light all Nations of them that are ſaved muſt walk: In which light, is the Saints Union known, and the Blood of the Lamb witneſſed, which was ſhed for many to remit ſin. And thou who would inſtigate people againſt the light of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and endeavours to perſwade that it is <hi>Popery</hi> to exhort people to hearken to the ſpirit of truth, or light of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them; neither enters by him thy ſelf, nor is willing to ſuffer others; but the day is appeared, and the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40694:3"/> everlaſting light is manifeſting which will diſcover all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and thy refuge of lyes ſhall be ſwept away, and thy ſlanders will return upon thy own head, in the day when the Lord pleads with thee for all thy hard ſpeeches, and rewards thee according to thy doings.</p>
            <p>Whereas, <hi>Thou calls thy Pamphlet, the Quaker-Jeſuite, Or, Popery in Quakeriſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The people of God who are by the world, in ſcorne called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do deny thee and the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and all theirs and thy doctrines, that are contrary to the truth, and diſtructive to mens ſalvation; and as for thy ſaying, there is <hi>Popery in Quakeriſme;</hi> No <hi>Popery</hi> thou haſt or canſt prove to be amongſt us, or any doctrines that's contrary to the holy Scriptures and Goſpel of Chriſt; therefore will theſe thy ſayings and ſlandrous words, that there is <hi>Popery</hi> in <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſme,</hi> return upon thy own head, and be thy burden at laſt, Except thou confeſs thy fault and Repent.</p>
            <p>And whereas, thou further calls thy Pamphlet, <hi>A cleare diſcovery, that their doctrines, with their proofs and arguments, are fetch out of the Counſel of</hi> Trent, Bellarmine, <hi>and others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our doctrines which are the wholeſome doctrines of the Goſpel of Chriſt, which we have not received of man, neither were taught by men, but by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are not fetch out of the Counſel of <hi>Trent, Bellarmine</hi> and others; but it is no wonder, that thou being blind, ſaith that our doctrines are fetch out of the Counſel of <hi>Trent, Bellarmine</hi> and others, when thou ſayeſt thoſe good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſayings, <hi>Of the holy Scriptures and Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> which thou thy ſelf haſt quoted as proofs, which we bring for our doctrines, are fetch out of the <hi>Counſel of Trent, Ballarmine</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> was the <hi>Counſel of Trent, Ballarmine</hi> and <hi>others, the Original of thoſe Scriptures?</hi> or are they <hi>Popery?</hi> and we <hi>Papiſts</hi> for bringing them to beare teſtimony of our doctrines? Canſt thou behold thy work again, and not be aſhamed, when thou ſeeſt thy folly and Ignorance made manifeſt unto all that have the leaſt meaſure of true knowledg? Is thy <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet</hi> a cleare diſcovery, that our arguments are fetch out of the <hi>Counſel of Trent,</hi> when here is not not any of our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40694:3"/> in all thy <hi>Pamphlet;</hi> but onely a few doctrines ſtated in ſuch a manner, as hath pleaſed thee to ſtate them; but our doctrines, which are the wholeſome doctrines of truth, which thou haſt not, nor canſt not diſprove; but thy own ſelf haſt quoted the Scriptures, which doth in effect prove the things of which we ſay. Therefore let that mouth be for ever ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that ſayth they and their proofs, which is the words of the holy Scriptures, are fetch out of the <hi>Councel of Trent, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> and <hi>others;</hi> And ſo thy ſlanders of us, and our doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, and the holy Scriptures, ſhall returne back upon thy own head, until thou confeſs thy folly and repent, and do no more ſo wickedly.</p>
            <p>And thou further ſaith, <hi>that their practiſes are fetcht out of the Rules of Popiſh</hi> Monks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is utterly falſe, for our practiſes have we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as <hi>traditions</hi> from them, neither do we walk by their rules, but by the rules of the Spirit of Truth, by which we are led from that which is evil, and through which we receive power to practice that which is good, which ſpirit is become our leader into all truth, and will abide with us for ever.</p>
            <p>Whereas thou begins thy <hi>Diſſwaſive Exhortation;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Beloved, The reſpect that I beare to your Souls, the Trvth's, and Church of Chriſt, much endangered by ſecret and unweared actings of the Emiſſaries of</hi> Rome.</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay of this as of the reſt of thy ſlanders, that it is altogether untrue, for no doctrines do we preach and hold forth, but the doctrines of the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt;</hi> and for the defence of them and manifeſtation that they are true againſt thee, and all that oppoſe them; we can bring pertinent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes out of the holy ſayings <hi>of the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles Words,</hi> who preached the ſame Goſpel and Doctrines
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40694:5"/> before us; and no doctrine of ours, if rightly ſtated, and as we preach them, haſt thou parallel'd with the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and thier doctrines, but thou mighteſt as well have parallel'd the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> with the doctrine of the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as it will after more fully appear in our own ſtating, the vindication and proof of our doctrines to be true, which thou haſt not, neither ever canſt confute or diſprove by the truth or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; Therefore thy ſlander of our doctrines will returne back upon thy ſelfe, having replyed againſt ſome of thy ſlanders and untruths, caſt upon us and our doctrines; I ſhall go on to the right ſtating, and more full manifeſtation of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, to be the ſound and wholeſome doctines of Truth; though thou haſt parallel'd them with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that it may appear more fully, that wherein thou haſt parallel'd our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, with any thing they ſay which is truths in themſelves, thou might as well a parallel'd the Apoſtles with them, becauſe they may hold ſome of the ſame truths in the unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which the Apoſtles held forth, and we hold in the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſſe, and thou thy ſelf confeſſes <hi>they hold ſome truths.</hi>

            <p>And as concerning the third, which thou ſtates as out of our Doctrines, in which thou compares us with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> we do deny it; it is not any of our Doctrines, either held or preached by us, as thou haſt ſtated it; and in ſtating, <hi>that we hold Juſtification by obedience,</hi> thou haſt not done honeſtly; was not thou formerly anſwered? that we are not juſtified by any obedience that is of the Creature, <hi>but by the free gift of God in Chriſt.</hi> Therefore I further ſay, that we are not juſtified by our obedience, or for our obedience; <hi>but in and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to whom we are obedient.</hi>

            <p>Whereas thou further ſaith, <hi>and eminent</hi> ſpeaker <hi>among them in the hearing of multitudes, aſſerted, that the righteouſneſs that was wrought by the Power of God in the hearts of the Gentiles,</hi> mention'd Rom. 2. 14. 15. <hi>is a righteouſneſſe whereby they were juſtified in the ſight of God; Anſw.</hi> To this I ſay concerning the Gentiles, in doing well and working righteouſneſſe, they were accepted and juſtified in the ſight of God, according to that of the Apoſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation he that fears him and worketh righteouſneſſe is accepted with him,</hi> Acts 10. 34. 35.

            <p>And whereas in the fourth thou ſpeaks of <hi>Judas, Being a godly man until Chriſt gave him the Sop, the Devil thereupon entered into him.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In that thou haſt ſtated theſe words again thou haſt not done honeſtly, becauſe thou haſt formerly been anſwered, that we did not own this Principle as it is ſtated, (to wit) <hi>That</hi> Judas <hi>was a godly man till he received the Sop;</hi> and we had ground for the denying of this Principle and others as they were ſtated, becauſe the young men themſelves did affirm, they were not ſo written as they ſpoke them; but this we do affirm, that <hi>Judas</hi> who was numbred with the Apoſtles, and had obtained part of the Miniſtry, and others fell away; as we can fully prove by the Scriptures of truth, where it is ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 25. <hi>That he may take part of this Miniſtry, from which</hi> Judas <hi>by tranſgreſſion fell;</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 5, 6. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20, 21, 22. where it it is ſaid, <hi>It had been better for them not to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, then after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them, but it is happened unto them according to the true Proverb,</hi> the Dog <hi>is turned to his vomit again, and the</hi> Sow <hi>that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire;</hi> more Scriptures might have been mentioned, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24. and others; <hi>but by the mouth of two or three witneſſes every truth ſhall be confirmed,</hi> but theſe Scriptures I have not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40694:6"/> aſſerted, to plead for falling away from grace and truth, but to beare witneſſe to the truth of our judgement in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and to manifeſt the wickedneſſe of our adverſary, who counts that <hi>Popery,</hi> that is plain Scriptures, as ſome of which he himſelf hath quoted, doth bear teſtimony; but it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſeeing he ſaith, the proofs themſelves which is Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>is fetcht out of the Councel of</hi> Trent, Bellarmine and others.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>that Pagans, and Turks, living juſtly and honeſtly, may be juſtified and ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I ſay further, <hi>that there is no reſpect of perſons with God, but in every Nation, whether they be Jewes, or Gentiles, Turks, or Pagans, yet if they fear God and work righteouſneſſe, of him they are accepted,</hi> and whether he be a <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> if he come to believe in Chriſt, and follow his Spirit and light, which leads to live juſtly and honeſtly, he may be juſtified and ſaved in and through Chriſt; And this doctrine is no <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> nor rightly can be parallel'd with theirs, any more than the Apoſtles doctrine; was to be parallel'd with the <hi>Papiſts, Acts</hi> 10. 34. where <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of a <hi>truth, I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, where thou ſayeſt, <hi>there is no abſolute decree of Election, and reprobation from Eternity, and ſayeſt, ſee a late Confeſſion of Faith by</hi> Burroughs.</p>
            <p>To this I ſay there is no ſuch poſition in his confeſſion of faith, as thou here hath aſſerted; but that we do believe that their is a ſtate of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> as is there confeſt, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly thou ſayeſt, <hi>that the Scriptures are not the Rule, this is charged upon them by the Miniſters of</hi> New-Caſtle, <hi>as thou ſayeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſay, as many as are begotten of the immortal ſeed to a lively hope, by the word of God which abides for ever; are his ſons and children, and ſuch are led by the Spirit of God, and it is their rule and not the letter; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. and yet ſuch are not <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor to be parallel'd with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who ſhews the Scriptures are not neceſſary, <hi>for they acknowledge that they are neceſſary, that the man of God may be perfect, and</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:40694:7"/> 
               <hi>throughly furniſhed, unto all good works,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, thou compares us to the papiſts, <hi>for ſaying the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Infants is not to be proved by the Scripture, and quotes Bellarmine for calling it a tradition, that's no where written.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſay though we are no <hi>Papiſts,</hi> yet I believe that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confeſſes in this thing more truth than thou, for it is very like it is a tradition, which in its beginning was inſtituted by the <hi>Papiſts Church;</hi> yet however this I am ſure of, that it is not recorded in the Scriptures of truth, that ever God commanded it, or any of his Miniſters whom he ſent forth practiced it, therefore the <hi>Papiſt</hi> and thou that preaches it up as an ordinance of God, is required to prove (if you can) when God ordained it, or any of his Apoſtles practiced it, and if you cannot, Confeſs you have taught for ordinances, mens traditions, and ſeeing the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it is a tradition, well may you <hi>Proteſtants</hi> doe the ſame, for you had the practice of ſprinkling Infants from them, and in this you have drunk the whores cup.</p>
            <p>Ninethly, whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>that one day of ſeaven which we call the Lords day, is no more than any other day, and that it is without divine Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſay further, there is no command of God in the Scriptures, for obſerving the firſt day of the week as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both of reſt, by ceaſing from all bodyly labour, of man ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or maid ſervant, cattle and ſtranger that is within our gates, as there was a command of God to the Jewes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſeaventh day, and keep it holy to the Lord for a Sabboth of reſt to them; their ſons and daughters, man-ſervants, and maid-ſervant, cattel, and ſtranger, that was within their gates, which Sabboth unto them was a ſigne: and thou further ſayeſt, we make it Tipecal, in which thou compares us to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> which compariſon is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, for though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> counted it Tipical, yet we make it not Tipecal, for it was the ſeaventh day, and not the firſt day which we ſay was a ſigne: and concerning the firſt day of the week, if thou hold that it was commanded by divine Authority, as the ſeaventh day once was; when thou writes again, ſhew when it was commanded, and where the holy Scriptures teſtifies of any ſuch Command.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40694:7"/>
            <p>Tenthly, whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>that we ſay the Lords Supper as adminiſtred in your Churches, is nothing but a bit of bread and wine, and that we ſpeak ſcornfully of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſay, when thou writes again, I deſire thee to ſhew us an example if thou canſt, where ever the Apoſtles and true Church mett together in a <hi>Steeple Houſe, or Idolls Temple,</hi> and broke bread in ſuch a form and manner among uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted people as you do? calling it the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> or a <hi>Sacrament?</hi> but the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which is ſo in truth we do freely own; and whereas thou compares us with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in ſaying, we ſpeak ſcornfully of that which you call the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> in this I ſay, thy comparing of us with them is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unequal, for we do not ſpeak ſcornfully of it; but where we ſee either the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or you in an error, we do rather pitty you than ſcorn you; and deſires that you may be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of all error, and be ſaved in the day of the Lord; yet we do deſpiſe and reject the vain traditions of men, which is practiſed for the worſhip of God by you.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, thou ſayeſt, <hi>that wee affirm that Proteſtants Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, are no Miniſters of Chriſt, that we uſe the vileſt Language againſt you; that we can invent, deny your call, and ſay you came from</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If thou meaneſt by <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters;</hi> of ſuch of you, <hi>as ſeeks for your gain from your quarters, and Preaches for hire,</hi> and makes a bargain for ſo much a year, theſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being the ſame as the falſe <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> are in, doth in ſome meaſure demonſtrate that your begining was from <hi>Rome,</hi> for no example can you ſhew for thoſe practices afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, among all the <hi>Holy Prophets or Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi> that have been ſince the begining.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>that we uſe the vileſt language that we can invent againſt you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, this is utterly falſe, for no vile language do we uſe or invent againſt you; but the language of truth, telling you plainly without flattering of the evil of your wayes, that you may repent, and in thus doing we have the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of old for our example.</p>
            <p>Twelfly, <hi>that we have the ſame ſpirit of Infallability, that the Apoſtles had.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40694:8"/>
            <p>To this I ſay further, both we and all Gods children, who are of the little flock, have the ſame Infallible Spirit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its <hi>meaſure and manifeſtation, which is given to every child of God to profit withall,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 7. and both thou, and all that ſay they have it not, but counts it <hi>Popery,</hi> for any to confeſs they have it, art ſo far from being a <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> that both thou and they that have it not, are not yet of his flock, for the Apoſtle ſaith plainly, if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. and yet he was no <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor with them to be parallel'd, no more are we that confeſſe <hi>we have the Spirit of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I having rightly ſtated, and vindicated our doctrines againſt thy ſlanders, and proved them by the holy Scriptures to be the wholeſome and ſound doctrines of the Goſpel; I ſhall go on to lay open, and reply againſt thy ſlanders and falſities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, in which thou haſt compared us with the <hi>Popiſh Monks;</hi> but it had been more wiſdome, and more like a <hi>Miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> to enquired truly into our practices, before thou had given judgement upon us, or have compared us to the <hi>Popiſh Monks,</hi> in whoſe diſcipiline thou ſayeſt, we ſeem to be admirably inſtructed, as will appear by thy following parallels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> thoſe falſe parallels, and thy unrighteous judgement of us without knowledge, will not make it appear that we are inſtructed in the practice and diſcipline of <hi>Popiſh Monks;</hi> whoſe practice and diſcipline we deny, but rather will diſcover thy folly, and manifeſt thy unrighteous judgement concerning our practices; for which we have example out of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>Firſt, thou ſayeſt, <hi>we lay much ſtreſs upon mean and plaine Apparel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou haſt altogether miſt in this thy judgement of us, for no ſtreſſe do we lay upon any viſible thing for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but in and through <hi>Chriſt</hi> onely and alone, have wee Salvation and life Eternal; and as for <hi>apparel</hi> and <hi>rayment</hi> wee take no thought, and whether it be mean or not mean apparel which the Lord affords us, with it we are content, yet our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that wee are of, doth keep us out of the vanities and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40694:8"/> pride of the world, of which their fooliſhneſſe in apparel doth many times ſignify.</p>
            <p>Secondly thou ſayeſt, <hi>that we practice ſilence, eſpecially at ſome times, and lay much of our Religion upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy judgement in this thing; as in many others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together falſe, for our Religion did we never lay upon ſilence, yet we have practiced, and do practice, waiting in the will and council of God, until his mind and word be revealed to us, whereby we may edify, and build up one another in the moſt holy faith, upon that foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf being the cheif Corner Stone.</p>
            <p>Thirdly thou ſayeſt, <hi>that we practice faſting much, in our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon this way, and afterwards as a ſpecial means of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual knowledge,</hi> viz. <hi>James Parnell in Colcheſter Goal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That we have practiced <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> that wee ſhall not deny but freely confeſſe; yet in ſo doing, wee are no more to be compared to the <hi>Monks,</hi> than was thoſe holy men to be compared with them, (to witt) <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and many others that might be Inſtanced, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 24. where <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>my knees are weak through faſting, and my fleſh fails of fatneſſe, and</hi> Dan. 10. 3. where he ſaith, <hi>I eat no pleaſant bread, neither came fleſh or wine within my mouth, neither did anoynt my ſelf at all, till three whole weeks were fulfill'd;</hi> theſe holy men, and many more have wee for our Example, which if they were now upon Earth, would be judged to be <hi>Popiſh Monks,</hi> by that ſpirit which now judges us, and thou ſayeſt, <hi>afterwards as a ſpecial means of ſpiritual knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this as in the reſt, thou haſt given falſe judgement alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though we have practiced <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayer;</hi> yet wee never eſtemed it, as the ſpecial means of <hi>ſpiritual knowledge.</hi> And whereas thou further ſpeaks of <hi>James Parnel,</hi> in <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter Goal;</hi> To this I ſay, the blood of the Innocent ſervant of the Lord, will come upon this Generation of <hi>hireling Prieſts, and envious Teachers,</hi> who hath been a great cauſe of ſtirring up the Magiſtrates, to all the perſecutions and ſufferings, that have been afflicted upon the ſervants of the Lord, who have not counted their lives dear unto themſelves, that they might finiſh their courſe with joy, and teſtimony, which they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40694:9"/> had received of the Lord Jeſus, but have even laid down their lives, as a ſeal of their teſtimony, as <hi>James Parnel,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Fourthly thou ſayeſt, <hi>we run up and down naked, though not conſtantly, but at ſometimes.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay, thou canſt no more truly compare them that have gone naked in obedience to the command of the Lord, for a ſigne and a wonder unto the world, (whoſe falſe cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings muſt be ſtript off, and all their ſecret evills manifeſt, and their ſhame made openly to appear) <hi>to the Grandfather of the Jeſuits in this age,</hi> than thou canſt compare, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Micah,</hi> true prophets to Idolaters in their age, <hi>who went naked and barefoot three years, for a ſigne and a wonder upon Egypt, and Ethiopia,</hi> Iſaiah 20. and the true Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>I will waile and howl, and go ſtript and naked,</hi> Micah 1. 8.</p>
            <p>Fifthly thou ſaith, <hi>we caſt off reſpect due to our Parents and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, witneſſe the complaint I have heard of ſome of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whatſoever thou haſt heard, The practice of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of many children to their Parents, may be a witneſſe againſt thee; that they do not caſt of the reſpect due to their Parents and Relations, many of their Parents would even teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the ſame, that their children who walks in the truth, unto them is not diſobedient.</p>
            <p>Sixthly thou ſayeſt, <hi>we aſcribe great perfection to our ſelves, calling all other men the men of the world, but ſaith, they themſelves are perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This aſſertion of thine concerning us, is abſolutely falſe, as thy others hath been; <hi>for unto ſelfe, or our ſelves, wee do not aſcribe any perfection,</hi> but ſay that perfection is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in and through Chriſt onely, who teaches us, and all that follow him, to deny our ſelves, though thou haſt ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us, that they themſelves are perfect; and haſt aſſerted that thy ſelf, for which thou would condemn us, of which we are not guilty, and ſo this ſlander of us will returne back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſelf, <hi>(that we aſcribe perfection to our ſelves)</hi> as the others hath done.</p>
            <p>Seaventhly thou ſayeſt, <hi>Quakers lay claim to viſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee muſt confeſſe, that we have ſeen <hi>viſions,</hi> and have had <hi>revelations,</hi> by which the mind of God hath been known, and the things of his Kingdom opened to us, and in us, yet haſt thou no more true ground to compare us to <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> becauſe we have had true <hi>viſions,</hi> than thou haſt to compare <hi>Abraham and Jacob and others,</hi> to the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Nuns;</hi> for the word of the Lord came to <hi>Abraham in a viſion,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I am thy Shield, and exceeding great Reward,</hi> Gen. 15. 8. 1. <hi>and the viſion of Iſaiah the Son of</hi> Amos, <hi>which he ſaw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> Juda <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1. 1. but thy ſaying, <hi>that we boaſt of more ſpiritual diſcoveries than other men;</hi> It is utterly falſe, for of ſuch things we do not boaſt, and thou goes on <hi>telling of one groſly dealt with by an evill ſpirit,</hi> and thou ſayeſt, witneſſe <hi>John Gilpin,</hi> To this I ſay, all lying viſions and dreams, and ſuch as are dealt with, and led with the evill ſpirit, as was <hi>John Gilpin,</hi> we do deny; for he never was of us, but a prophane man of the world, and one with the hirelings againſt us.</p>
            <p>Eightly, thou ſayeſt, <hi>they place their Religion in meer circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and formalities, leaving off of hattbands, ribbons, lace, thou-ing perſons, but are wanting, in the true eſteem of the true practice of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy aſſertion, that we place Religion in thoſe things aforementioned, is utterly falſe, as the reſt of thy aſſertions of us, and our Religion hath been; for our Religion is not placed in <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> as thou haſt falſly aſſerted, but in the Power of God, by which we are kept unſpotted from the world. And whereas thou accuſeth us, <hi>to be wanting in the eſteem of true practices of Religion;</hi> when thou writes again, ſet downe in particular what thoſe practices are, which thou calls, or can prove to be the true practices of Religion, which thou accuſes us, to be wanting in the eſteem of.</p>
            <p>Ninethly thou ſayeſt, <hi>they carry a ſhew of ſelf-denial, abne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the world, contempt of riches, envy againſt the Miniſters of Chriſt, for having maintenance, as if themſelves had nothing; yet thrives faſt, payes their debts, makes purchaſes, getts good Eſtates, wear of late rich Cloaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:40694:10"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy aſſertion in this is utterly falſe, as the reſt have been, for we do not envy againſt the Miniſters of Chriſt for having maintenance, but acknowledge that they that preach the Goſpel may live of the Goſpel, according to Gods Ordinance, <hi>and they that ſow ſpiritual things, may reap carnal things; but having food and rayment, are therewith to be content,</hi> and there is no example amongſt them, for being hired at a Pariſh, or making a bargain for ſo much as <hi>foureſcore,</hi> or a <hi>hundred pounds,</hi> more or leſs as they can get it by the year, or <hi>tithes</hi> of all the people poſſeſſes, as the <hi>hireling Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> have done; and for thy ſaying, <hi>they thrive faſt, and paying depts, and gets good eſtates;</hi> to which I ſay, when thou writes again, inſtance one that is owned as a <hi>Miniſter</hi> amongſt us, (that through gain made of the Miniſtry) who had nothing, that hath done any of theſe things aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and till then, let this ſlander returne back upon thy ſelf, as the reſt have done, and if God bleſſe any of his people with outward encreaſe, why doeſt thou envious wretch reproach them becauſe of Gods mercyes? Thou ſayeſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>that we wear rich Cloaths.</hi> To this I ſay, how fully haſt thou contradicted thy ſelf, in the firſt of thy aſſertions, in which thou parallel'd us with the <hi>Monks,</hi> in thy ſaying, that we lay much ſtreſs upon plain and mean apparel, and now haſt ſo far forgotten thy ſelfe, that the ſame tongue ſaith now, <hi>we weare rich Cloaths,</hi> but in this thy envy againſt the truth is manifeſt; and however they go that walk in it, whether well in cloaths, or mean in cloaths, it will not pleaſe thee, nor the envyous generation that loves not their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as their ſelves.</p>
            <p>And further thou tells, <hi>of having ſtocks of money; out of which thou ſuppoſes we have great and large ſumes, when wee have a mind to travel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I ſhall anſwer, thy ſuppoſition is falſe, as the reſt of thy ſayings have been; and if there be any ſuch thing as ſtocks of money for the maintaining of the poor, and other neceſſary uſes among Friends; is not this of good report, and like Saints, more than they in your Churches, where your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is like to ſtarve, and begs?</p>
            <p>Tenthly thou ſayeſt, <hi>wee are a ſeduced people, and active in</hi>

               <hi>ſeducing others, being ignorant and unlearned, yet an importunant, and unweared people, compaſſing Sea and Land, to make one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte, yet not for themſelves, but for thoſe Sophiſters of</hi> Rome, <hi>whoſe factors they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is altogether falſe, as the reſt of thy ſlanders have been, for <hi>Romes Factors</hi> we are not, nor for them do we make proſelytes.</p>
            <p>And for thy ſaying, <hi>that we are a ſeducing people, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeducing others; I Anſwer,</hi> this is altogether falſe, as thy other aſſertions concerning us hath been, for we are not <hi>ſeduced,</hi> nor active in <hi>ſeducing</hi> others; nor yet ignorant and unlearned in the things that appertains to Gods Kingdome, our Salvation, and the Salvation of them that hears us.</p>
            <p>Eleaventhly, thou ſayeſt, <hi>now I hope I have made it evident, that the hand of a Jeſuite is in the Quakers Religion; how could they elſe be ſo well verſt in their abſur'd doctrines?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The hope of the hypocrite is vain, and his truſt is like the ſpiders web, for thou neither haſt, or can manifeſt the hand of of a <hi>Jeſuite</hi> to be in our Religion; nor any doctrine that is truly ours, haſt thou manifeſt to be abſur'd, or proved to be contrary to the truth and doctrines of the Goſpel of Chriſt; But it is manifeſt, thou art verſt in the <hi>Papiſts</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and doctrines, otherwiſe thou could not have ſtated ſo many of them, and their practices; therefore thy ſaying that we are verſt in their abſur'd doctrines, is falſe, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne upon thy ſelf, who art guilty therein: and thou goes on ſaying, <hi>I will conclude with a re-inforcement, of my diſſwaſive of you, from their doctrines and practices; They are from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, therefore avoid them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Our doctrines, which is the doctrines of truth, and our practices, for which we have example among the Prophets and Miniſters of Chriſt; all the lyes and ſlanders, which thou and all the Merchants of <hi>Babylon</hi> can caſt upon us, or upon our doctrines, cannot diſſwade from our way, (which is the way of God) any of them who hath the leaſt meaſure of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; therefore the adding thy reaſons, as thou calls them, to imprint in people, a deep hatred againſt our way, which is truth, ſhall not be effectual, for thy refuge of lyes ſhall be ſwept
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40694:11"/> away; and unrighteous ſlanders turned back upon thy own head, in the dreadful day of the Lord when he rewards thee, and all the wicked according to their doings.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of thy reaſons, thou ſayeſt, <hi>they are miſerably divided among themſelves about their principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is falſe, for we who are in the truth, and walks in the light, have unity, and are not divided amongſt our ſelves about our principles; though we did deny ſeveral of thoſe things, as they were ſtated, having good reaſon ſo to do, becauſe they were ſtated in thy manner, and as thou our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie pleaſed to ſtate them and the young men affirm not in the very ſame words, and form as they ſpoke them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſayeſt, the fourth of theſe reaſons <hi>was again owned in a diſcourſe,</hi> (viz) <hi>that we are juſtified by obedience;</hi> To which I ſay, it is utterly falſe, for no ſuch thing was owned by any of us, neither of it was there any diſcourſe betwixt thee and us that day.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou further calls it a <hi>contradiction, to ſay that every man is lighted with the true light which is Chriſt. And yet not ſpiritually enlightned with the knowledge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this, thy ignorance, and want of underſtanding in the things of God, is manifeſt; in calling that a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which is no contradiction; for both theſe ſayings in effect may be proved by plain words of Scriptures, as <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. where it is ſaid, <hi>that was the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>poure out thy wrath upon the heathen that know thee not,</hi> Jer. 10. 25. So it is evident, that the heathen know not God, therefore may it truly be ſaid, without contradicting <hi>Johns</hi> teſtimony, that every one is not enlightned with the ſpiritual knowledge of God, though that teſtimony is true, that ſaith, <hi>the true light that lighteth every man, yet every man doth not believe in,</hi> and receive the light which manifeſteth thoſe evil deeds, for which he is reproved; therefore every man hath not the knowledge of God, becauſe ſome rejects his Light which would give the knowledge of him.</p>
            <p>And thou goes on and ſayeſt, <hi>their doctrines which they broach with confidence, among their ſilly credulous followers, they will not dare to owne before others.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40694:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For our doctrines and teſtimonies, that we have given <hi>of Chriſt the true light of the world,</hi> we both dare, and have openly owned before the world; Therefore, this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is utterly falſe, and no true ground thou haſt to ſay ſo concerning us; but thou mayeſt imagine thou haſt ſome ground, becauſe we would not be tyed to expreſs our ſelves, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the light in ſuch a way and manner, as thou would have preſcribed to us, or have our principles ſtated in a form of words, to which thou would have limitted us.</p>
            <p>And thou goes on in thy falſe accuſations, ſaying, <hi>that which hath been vainly attempted by Antichriſt, is their very deſigne, if accompliſhed; do but think how the Papiſts would rejoyce in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which hath been attempted by Antichriſt, is not our deſigne; neither in the accompliſhment of our ends and deſires, will either he or the Papiſts rejoyce; for our ends and and deſire is, that people may be brought from under Satans dominions, and led out of the Ignorance and groſſe darkneſſe, that hath long covered the inhabitants of the earth, into the true knowledge of the living God, that they may him worſhip and glorify, in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
            <p>And in the fourth, thou ſayeſt, <hi>they never yet that I have heard of, did oppoſe any of thoſe fundamental truths we have preached unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this thou haſt cleared us from the great ſlander, which in the former thou caſt upon us, for we never did, nor do oppoſe any fundamental truths, though both you, and the Papiſts, may hold them, and preach them in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe. Thus contradicting of thy falſe ſayings, in thy third reaſon thou haſt cleared us, and ſo what hath been attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Antichriſt, and falſe Miniſters againſt fundamental truths, was never our deſigne, as thy ſelf haſt confeſſed, that we never oppoſed any fundamental truths that ever thou heard of, yet though we have not oppoſed any fundamental ſayings of Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſpoken by you; yet we have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed thoſe fundamental errors ſpoken by you; as witneſſe that fundamental errors ſpoken by thee, in our conference at <hi>Kendal,</hi> (viz) <hi>that there is in every man a natural light, that gives them ſome meaſure of the knowledge of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40694:12"/>
            <p>And this I did oppoſe thee in; and ſhall beare my teſtimony againſt it, for it is an error in the fundamental, even in that which concerns the eternal life of ſouls, when time ſhall be no more: for if this were true (viz) <hi>that every man by a natural light hath</hi> a meaſure of <hi>the knowledge of God;</hi> then everyman had eternal life, &amp; all drunkards and prophane perſons upon earth, were in a ſtate of happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And as concerning thy reproachful ſayings in thy Epilogue, thou calls us <hi>the Popes very Pedlars, to ſell off his corrupt wares in ſtalls, which would never off in ſhops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thy jeers, and unrighteous ſayings concerning us, will returne upon thy own head; for the <hi>Pope</hi> we deny, and his corrupt wares we deny; amongſt us neither his nor thine, is of any eſtimation, but me thinks thou and thy brethren, who have been made Miniſters by natural educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and humane learning and arts, and having got the Maſs-houſe, which originally appertaining to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which they founded and <hi>conſecrated</hi> for their <hi>Idolatrous worſhip,</hi> in which you now ſell your wares, for which you receive the ſame price and wages, which was once eſteemed due to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and his <hi>Clergy:</hi> therefore if any in the Nation be his <hi>Pedlars, Mountebanks,</hi> and <hi>drudges;</hi> you are to be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>And thou further ſayeſt, <hi>I might have fil'd ſheets with their faſtings and viſions, and impulſes to ſtrange actions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſay, when thou writes again, ſay all that thou canſt concerning our faſtings and viſions, and ceaſe to ſlander in the dark, by which thou endeavours to perſwade the Ignorant, that thou could manifeſt ſome great evills concerning our faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and viſions.</p>
            <p>Whereas thou ſpeaks of <hi>impulſes</hi> and <hi>ſtrange actions:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſay, impulſes and actions, that is out of truth and Power of God, is denyed by us, and all that is excerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed therein.</p>
            <p>And thou further ſayeſt, <hi>do you of this place conſider, and ſuch of you as have been former profeſſors, look back to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; your Apoſtacy hath been the grief of many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſay, how can there be an Apoſtacy, and falling from the truth, of any, if they never have been in the truth;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40694:12"/> and though the people of God at <hi>Kendall,</hi> that is gathered from the falſe <hi>Shepherds</hi> and <hi>hirelings,</hi> be not fallen from the Truth and Grace of Chriſt; yet thy ſpeaking that they are <hi>Apoſtatized,</hi> and bidding them returne from whence they are fallen; doth clearly demonſtrate that thou admits that their may be a falling away; which is the very ſame thing, that thou haſt denyed of ours as an error; and for aſſerting that ſome fell away; thou haſt compared us to the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> canſt thou behold this again, and not ſee thy ſelf in confuſion, one while build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and another while throwing down? for if thou doeſt not believe that their can be a falling from true grace; why doſt thou exhort them to returne, from whence thou ſayeſt they are fallen?</p>
            <p>A few Queſtions to thee <hi>William Brownſword,</hi> who ſayeſt our doctrines are <hi>Popery;</hi> which we have proved by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be the doctrines of truth, and can no more rightly be compared to the doctrines of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> than the doctrines of the Apoſtles can be compared with the doctrines of the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> Therefore thou art deſired to anſwer theſe queſtions, in plainneſſe, without ſhuffling or evading; that ſo the ground of thy judgement may be more fully manifeſt to all. And what reaſon thou haſt to parallel our doctrines and practices, with the doctrines and practices of the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> Seeing we of all people do not onely teſtify againſt the corrupt doctrines, and practices of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in other Nations, but alſo againſt the Reliques of <hi>Popery</hi> in this Nation, that is found amongſt the hireling Prieſts and Miniſters, that is made by the will of man, and not by the will of God, and gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

            <head>A Poſt-ſcript. To <hi>William Brownſword,</hi> and his Pariſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>Kendall.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS concerning thy book ſent abroad by thee in oppoſition to the Lords Truth and his People, we have ſeen, read, and conſidered, and do find it light and empty, and a dry confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed piece, even as a little old ſcrap of <hi>Babylons</hi> treaſure, worth nothing at all, except to ſhew the Authors weakneſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and to give occaſion againſt himſelf, that he may be beat with his own weapon: and certain it is, that his work (his <hi>Quaker-Jeſuite</hi> I mean) will not effect the end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe intended by him) but the Lord ſhall turn the end back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon him, and by that through which he hath thought to diſhonor the truth, and to make it odious among people, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thereby ſhall the truth gain an advantage, and appear in more beauty, and be more deſirable unto many, ſo that thy evil intent ſhall redound back upon thee; and doubtleſs ſome of thine own Flock, when they have compared thine with its Anſwer, they ſhall ſee the weakneſs and wickedneſs of the one, and the truth plainly proved in the other, and the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will be thine; for alas thou art a weak man, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thy Brethren in iniquity, to whom thou canſt not be compared for matter of wit and ſubtilty, but art ſhort of them, even as an Infant is of a man, and they have appeared in much more fair means and politique way than thou haſt done, and yet their work, brought forth in the height of great wit and knowledge, have been rejected by us, and through the Wiſdome of God confounded, and their braveſt work taken as our ſpoil of <hi>Babylons</hi> treaſure; and then how ſhouldſt thou and thy weak ſilly piece be otherwiſe than tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under our feet? and what art thou feeble child of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> that thou ſhouldſt thus adventure to come forth into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40694:14"/> view, wrapped in an old thred-bare garment; <hi>(Quaker-Jeſuite Popery in Quakeriſme, &amp;c.)</hi> and under this haſt thou covered a malicious heart, which the Lord will judge, and bring thee to feel the weight of thine own iniquities in his dreadful day.</p>
            <p>Alas friend, we are far otherwiſe known through this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and about <hi>Kendal</hi> eſpecially, we are known to be none ſuch as thou haſt falſly reputed us, not <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but on the contrary, we are known to be ſuch who have many of us zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly profeſſed the Lord, and earneſtly ſought after him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the daies of our childhood, and if any have whereof to glory in matter of outward profeſſion, we might have ſomething to ſay, as being ſuch who deſired after God, in our ſouls, in much ſincerity of heart, and worſhipped him after the ſtricteſt manner then held forth, and this from our Infancy; and upon what ground thou ſhould charge us with being <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> I know not, except it be to prove and ſhew thy ſelf both ignorant, ſlanderous, and ridiculous amongſt thy own hearers, who doubtleſs ſome of them may ſay, we know they are not ſuch as thou haſt ſaid, and the Witneſs in their conſciences may prove thee a lyar, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date thy book as an old <hi>Almanack,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it for the fire; and thou haſt wholly miſſed thy mark, if thou thoughteſt to lay a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block before thy Flock, concerning us, by this means of accuſing of us falſly, this ſhall do thee no good, but turn to an offence againſt thy own ſelf; and as thou thought to do to others, ſo ſhall it be done to thee, and thou and thy work ſhall be rejected; the one as ignorant and vain, the other as ignorance and vanity, for we are known to thy hearers to be neither <hi>Jeſuits</hi> nor <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but they can tell that thou art a falſe accuſer in this, And for thee to accuſe us where we have been ſo well known, renders thy ſelfe both ignorant and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; And it doth many wayes appear, That wee are not <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> partly as I have ſaid we were not ſuch in the dayes of our Infancy, neither educated nor practiſed therein, but were zealous againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> even from our childhood, as the People of <hi>Kendal</hi> very well knows, who can witneſs for us, and againſt thee, that we were neither ſuch, nor yet lovers of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40694:15"/> them, but were altogether zealous againſt them from our childhood, as I have ſaid.</p>
            <p>And it is evident, we have been no ſuch ſince we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by the name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> for we have given divers teſtimonies by writing in divers particular books, which I might mention againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as knowing Her not to be the true Church of Chriſt, but a falſe Church, made up of Apoſtates originally, and being Idolators in their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Church, Miniſtry, and whole Religion, this teſtimony we have borne at ſundry times, and upon divers occaſions; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we have given our teſtimony by writing againſt them, plain affirmations; and ſometimes in anſwer to their writings againſt us, and divers of us have been moved to go into their Dominions, and declare the Word of the Lord againſt their Idolatryes.</p>
            <p>And alſo divers of our friends forbearing their witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have ſuffered great and cruel things, ſome until death, and ſome at this day are in their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions</hi> and Goals, and under ſuffering by them, even for this cauſe, for we have a large teſtimony and witneſs to give againſt the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by what we have teſtified in word and writing, and by what we have ſuffered from them for ſo doing, it well appears, that we are not <hi>Jeſuites</hi> nor <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and with what face thou could accuſe us, it makes us to wonder at thy impudency, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt ſo little ground for it, but haſt upon thy malice thus falſly accuſed us, without any juſt cauſe at all; but this thy work which thou haſt done, ſhall return into thy own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, with the reward of Judgement, except thou repent, and ſin no more.</p>
            <p>Yes, but ſayeſt thou, you are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for why? Such and ſuch doctrines and practiſes you hold forth, and the like is held forth by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and this proves that you are ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Alas friend, thou haſt mightily diſcovered thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and folly in thus proceeding, and in thus judging; for doubtleſs the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may hold the profeſſion of ſome truths in doctrines and practiſes unto this day, even as thy own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did confeſs at a certain Meeting of Diſpute, they affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40694:15"/> to me, that there were many ſaving truths held by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſeeing that they hold that Chriſt Jeſus is the Saviour of the World, and that by him people comes to eternal life, and that he was born, and died, and roſe again; and ſeeing they hold that Saints muſt deny the world, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſin, and the evil of the world: Theſe doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, with many others, they do hold in words and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which are ſaving doctrines and practiſes in themſelves, though not to them; but becauſe they hold theſe things, muſt the People of God either deny theſe doctrines and practiſes, or elſe be accounted <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> for holding of them? And would not this be unrighteous Judgement according to which thou haſt judged us? But I muſt tell thee, we do hold the truth in righteouſneſs, both in doctrine and practiſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon this account, becauſe the Spirit of the Lord hath, and doth lead us into all truth, both in doctrine and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: And though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may hold the profeſſion of the ſame truth in words and outward appearance, yet this is no ground for us to deny the truth as it is in Jeſus, nor yet a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for thee to accuſe us to be <hi>Papiſts;</hi> but becauſe thou art both ignorant and wicked, therefore thou haſt thus proceeded, and thy work is a very ſcorn to many that are not <hi>Quakers,</hi> and they ſee thy errour and ignorance in thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
            <p>And wouldſt thou thus be dealt withall? And you Prieſts of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall we judge you according to thine own rule? might not I lay you to the line of Judgement? and may not I inſtnace many particular things both in doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, which are held forth by the Miniſters and Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> they hold the very ſame? and ſhall we therefore conclude lawfully, that all the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> and their People are <hi>Papiſts?</hi> Oh man! behold thy folly, and what a ſnare thou haſt laid for thy ſelf, and how thou art fallen into the pit which thou haſt digged for others. And further conſider, ſome of thoſe doctrines and practiſes which thou haſt charged upon us, are proveable and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Scriptures, even by the Apoſtles who held forth and practiſed the ſame things, and becauſe we hold and practiſe the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40694:16"/> ſame; therefore we are accounted <hi>Papiſts,</hi> from this rule, becauſe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> profeſs the ſame; like as if it were er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to ſay, Chriſt is the Son of God, becauſe the Devil ſaid ſo; and like as if it were an errour to believe there is a God, becauſe the Devils believe ſo; and by thy falſe propoſed rule, thou might have proved the one as ſoon as the other, and thou might have ſaid the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Devils, why? becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils confeſt Chriſt, and they believe there is a God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are devils; and would this be good <hi>Logick?</hi> And ſuch is thy <hi>Logick,</hi> thou illiterate man: Why this is thy work, the <hi>Papiſts</hi> they hold ſuch and ſuch things, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> they hold the ſame, and therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> are <hi>Papiſts:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſubſtance of thy work, thou vain man! thou, and thy work are both ridiculous to ſober-minded people.</p>
            <p>Now indeed if thou couldſt have inſtanced ſuch doctrines and practiſes held forth by us, which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do hold forth, which is neither provable nor exemplary in the Scriptures, then thy colour had been more fair, and thy pretence more ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: But becauſe thou haſt truly inſtanced nothing againſt us, neither in doctrine nor practiſe, but what we can prove ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by the Scriptures; therefore thy work is invalid, even to many that are not of us: For, ſay they, if this be <hi>Popery</hi> to follow the example of the Apoſtles in doctrine and practiſes, its better to be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> then a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> for why? the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> holds forth many doctrines and practiſes which are not prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Scriptures: and I might inſtance in many things, that this is true, even that you Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> doth hold forth in doctrine and practiſe, many things which is not proveable by the Scriptures, but in ſome things even contrary to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And what if I ſhould compare thee and thy Brethren in ſome of your doctrines and practiſes which you hold, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold the ſame, which is not according, nor proveable by the Scriptures, will not the concluſion fall upon thee and you, that you are <hi>Popiſh Jeſuites,</hi> and like unto them; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance a few things amongſt many: you are made Miniſters by Natural Learning and Languages, through the attainment of ſuch Arts and Sciences at Schools and Colledges, which the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40694:16"/> Apoſtles were not, and not by the immediate gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, as the Apoſtles were; and in this very way and manner are the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> made and ſent forth. And moreover, by the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were your Colledges builded and ordained for the very uſe and end which you make of them; and thoſe Revenues, as Tythes, and other things which you yet uphold, even your orders, habits, and formalities at Schools, were given and ordained even in the daies of <hi>Popery,</hi> and by the Whore of <hi>Romes</hi> Authority; and you are in the very practiſe of that which they practiſed in this particular, and you hold up and maintain that which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and firſt ordained, and therefore are not you <hi>Papiſts</hi> and upholders of <hi>Popery,</hi> let the witneſs in every mans conſcience judge, for you are doing and upholding the very ſame things which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, which the Apoſtles never did, and by thine own rule you are therefore <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, you are maintained in your Miniſtry by Tythes, Gleab-lands, Eaſter reckonings, yearly ſtipends, and ſo much by the year, and ſettled in a Parochial way; and thus were never the Apoſtles, nor found in ſuch practiſes; but the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they are in the practiſe of ſuch things that firſt inſtituted and ordained them in this Nation; and herein you follow their example, and not the example of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and therefore we may conclude that you are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and follows their ſpirit, and you practiſe what they practiſed, even without any example at all in the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſprinkle Infants, and ſayes, it is the Baptiſme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Viſible Church, and Original Sin is thereby waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and it is a Seal and a Sign of Regeneration, and of the Covenant, and this practiſe and doctrine the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold forth, and were indeed the firſt Founders and Ordainers of this practiſe and doctrine, and it hath never been proved yet to us from the Scriptures, but you hold it forth, and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> they hold forth the ſame; and therefore it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that you are <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and yet upholds <hi>Popery,</hi> by theſe and many other things that I might mention, which you do, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do the ſame, and without any proof or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40694:17"/> in the Scriptures, or any of the Apoſtles doth fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that you are more guilty of <hi>Popery</hi> then we are, and <hi>Popery</hi> remains yet amongſt you, and theſe practiſes are but a few of many I might mention; and this is but a hint at things which more largely might be ſpoken to, and it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned upon thee by thine own proceedings.</p>
            <p>And I muſt tell thee, that you are a company of ſhameleſs men, to cry out againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for is not She your Mother? and did not your Religion, your Church, and Miniſtry, and Worſhip, for the moſt part of it ſpring out of her bowels? Yea, it may eaſily be proved, that the general part of your Worſhip doth conſiſt of ſuch practiſes brought forth in ſuch a manner as was firſt inſtituted by the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> both the practiſes themſelves, and the very manner of their performances, and this may eaſily be proved; and therefore you are ſhameleſs men to cry out of your Mother who hath made ſuch fair proviſion for you, She hath inſtituted and taught you a way for making of Miniſters, and She hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and taught you a way of maintenance by Tythes, and ſo much a year, and ſhe hath provided you your very houſes for worſhipping in; for your Churches were her Maſs-houſes not many years ago: And thus She (the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> your Mother) hath made a large proviſion for you, She hath taught you a way of Baptiſme, as I have mentioned, and ſhe hath taught you alſo the way of perſecuting people for good conſcience ſake; it was She that kill'd and deſtroyed perſons for good conſcience ſake; and it was She that forced and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Faith and practiſes upon peoples conſciences, contrary to the Spirit of God, which you Miniſters yet practiſes in part. Many things I might inſtance to illuſtrate you to be like unto the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and even ſuch as have ſprung out of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But the Nation is begun already to ſee your ſhame and folly, and if I were ſilent, the Lord will not forget to repay his enemies with vengeance, and the day of the Lord is at hand, wherein his Judgements ſhall be known in the earth. And thus I have meaſured thee according to thy own rule, and I do leave it to the Witneſs of God in thy own Conſcience, and to all thy Pariſhioners, to whom indeed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40694:17"/> I do wiſh well, and that they might come to the knowledge of the things that belongs unto eternall life, that they might be ſaved. And ye people of <hi>Kendall,</hi> and there abouts: Oh that you would conſider! Oh that you would come to be taught of the Lord, and every one of you to receive the Spirit of God, which is the free gift of God, that it might lead you into all truth, according to the promiſe of the Lord; for this is his promiſe, <hi>That all his Children ſhall be taught of him, his Law ſhall be written in their hearts, and his Spirit put in their inward parts; and they ſhall all be taught of the Lord, and his Spirit ſhall lead them in all the wayes of righteouſneſſe:</hi> Oh! how long will it be ere you come out of Idolatry, and out of Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian wayes, which long you have walked in, and not only you, but all Chriſtian Nations, for great hath been that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that hath been upon the world ſince the Apoſtles daies; for Chriſt in his daies, he ſaid, <hi>Falſe Prophets ſhould come, and ſhould ariſe, and deceive many;</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> he ſaid in his time, that there was then already many falſe Prophets gone out into the world, and the world went after them: and the falſe Prophets which Chriſt propheſied of ſhould come, in the laſt times, the Apoſtles ſaw were already come, and coming in their daies, and it was then the laſt time, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. and ſuch were they, as you may read, that were covetous, and taught for filthy lucre, and through co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs made merchandize of people, and ſuch were they that preached for hire, ſuch as theſe, even Wolves in Sheeps cloathing, Chriſt ſaid ſhould come, and the Apoſtles ſaw were coming in, even in their daies; and abundance of ſuch as theſe have over-ſpread the Chriſtian Nations, for many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; ſo it is not as though the falſe Prophets were but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now, for that Scripture ſignifies, and plainly ſaith, that the falſe Prophets and Antichriſt did come in, even in the Apoſtles daies, and moſt of the Apoſtles themſelves were Martyred, and the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were running into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and back-ſliding from the truth, even before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles deceaſe; and <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> he ſaw what was to come to paſs, <hi>that Power ſhould be given to the Beaſt, and to</hi>

            <p>And yet though great darkneſs hath been over the Nations, yet the Lord had his people; that is, a few in every Nation, &amp; ſome in every age, that were ſincere in their hearts, &amp; did fear the Lord in Spirit, and did deſire after him, and that were in a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40694:18"/> meaſure humble before him; ſome ſuch have been among Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Proteſtants in all ages, who have according to their preſent time, been zealous in their way towards God: and ſuch have been dear to the Lord at all times, who ſought after him, and ſuffered for him, for their preſent teſtimony againſt ſin and iniquity, as it was manifeſt to them: and ſuch ſincerity of heart in any, we never have judged. Though we ſay, as for the matter of Government, Diſcipline or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and as for Miniſtry, the Call to it, and maintenance of it: all this, both among Papiſts and Proteſtants of all ſorts for the generality of it, hath been wholly Antichriſtian. Their Church Government, Ordinances, Worſhip, their Miniſtry, its Call, its Maintenance, hath been Antichriſtian, and not according to the example of the Apoſtles. And this we judge, even by the Spirit of the Lord; Though the ſincerity in no man, nor amongſt any ſort of people do we judge: yet the conſtitution of Churches, and the Worſhip and Ordinances, and Miniſtry as it hath ſtood for many ages, both among Papiſts and Proteſtants we do judge, and deny by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid as in theſe things, but if any of you Pariſhioners of <hi>Kendall</hi> deſire any further knowledge of theſe things, or to be acquainted with our Principles, we have given forth divers Books (though they have been reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted hitherto) yet the time is at hand when thoſe truthes which we have declared both by word and writing, ſhall be preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous throughout the world. And we do not impoſe our Religion upon people by force of external laws, as Papiſts and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants have done by Antichrian power: But we do leave what we declare by word or writing to the witneſſe of God, even in all mens conſciences thereby to be approved, and though we have been ſufferers, and yet may for good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake; yet we are not aſhamed of the truths which the Lord hath given us the knowledge of: But in all boldneſſe, and in the fear of God we confidently give forth our wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And as for this our anſwer, it is ſufficient to you, and your Miniſter, and no more needs be ſaid till we hear a reply, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40694:19"/> further then it is poſſible, the teſtimony of truth may be given, and I would deſire that you and he would ſincerely compare this, and his together, and then judge of the one, and of the other, even by the witneſſe of God in your own conſciences.</p>

               <p>Here follows certain propoſalls, which was ſent to <hi>William Brownſword</hi> about a year ago, which are worthy here of Inſerting, that he may yet anſwer to theſe things; for he would neither meet me to diſpute theſe things, nor give me any anſwer by writing. And indeed, it had been more equitable for him, firſt to have anſwered theſe things, than to have gone and ſent forth ſuch a fooliſh book againſt us: and all theſe things being compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I doubt not but ſome of you may be truly Informed, and your underſtandings opened; which is my earneſt deſire, that ſo it may be unto you, and that ye may come to a good underſtanding, and perfectly diſern betwen truth, and error, and true Miniſters of Chriſt, and deceivers.</p>

            <p>I am a lover of your Souls, and a friend to Righteouſneſſe, and dayly travelleth in the work of the Goſpel, to the intent that Sinners may be converted to God, and the Saints ſtrengthned in the Faith, which gives them victory over the world; and I wait for <hi>Sions</hi> Redemption, and for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of great Babylon, that hath ruled over the Kings of the Earth: and whereas it is manifeſt to me, that there is a great diſſatisfaction in the ſpirits of people in this Town and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hereabouts, concerning the Miniſtry; and the great cry is, who is a true Miniſter of Chriſt, and who is is not? ſome crying up one man, and ſome another: and it appears to me, that there is a great ſtrife in the mindes of people about Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Miniſtry; and about the Worſhip of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: ſome ſaying, <hi>This is the way;</hi> others ſaying, <hi>That is the way;</hi> and ſome crying, <hi>This is Truth;</hi> and others crying, <hi>That is Hereſie.</hi> Now to the intent, that all people may be ſatisfied, and that the way of Truth may be clearly known from all the falſe wayes of Error; and that the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Miniſtry ma be perfectly known, and diſtinguiſhed from all falſe Miniſtries, and that the Truth may be exalted over all, and all Deceipt confounded.</p>
